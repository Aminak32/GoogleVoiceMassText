GoogleVoiceMassText
===================

Python implentation of GoogleVoice to send a given message to a single or multiple numbers

The python is not my work. It was modified (from: https://code.google.com/p/pygooglevoice/) to fit my needs.

This was used as a Server response tool (Check IP, current users, etc.) and was then adapted to be used as a mass text server for an organization I am a part of.
